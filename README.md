# UDACITY Front-End ND Project 3 Arcade Game


## About the Project

Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.

- JavaScript enables the development of complex applications on the web.
- JavaScript runs on normal web browsers, which makes it one of the most accessible and flexible programming languages.
- Complex applications that must be “broken down” into simpler entities that manage their own properties and functionality
